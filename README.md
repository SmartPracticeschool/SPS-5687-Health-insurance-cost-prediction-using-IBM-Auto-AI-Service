Architecture Diagram



 

 
1. Logged into Watson Studio, creates a project named it as ‘insurance project ’ and initiates an instance of Auto AI & Object Storage.
2. Uploaded the data file in the CSV format to the object storage.
3. User initiates the model building process using Auto AI and create pipelines.
4. User evaluates different pipelines from Auto AI and selects the best model for deployment.
5. User generates accurate predictions by making ReST call to the deployed model
Included components
•	IBM Watson Studio: Analyze data using RStudio, Jupyter, and Python in a configured, collaborative environment that includes IBM value-adds, such as managed Spark.
•	IBM Auto AI:The AutoAI graphical tool in Watson Studio automatically analyzes your data and generates candidate model pipelines customized for your predictive modeling problem.
•	IBM Cloud Object Storage: An IBM Cloud service that provides an unstructured cloud data store to build and deliver cost effective apps and services with high reliability and fast speed to market. This code pattern uses Cloud Object Storage.
